Kazakhstan is the world's largest landlocked country by land area and the ninth largest country in the world; its territory of 2,724,900 square kilometres  is larger than Western Europe

The Russians began advancing into the Kazakh steppe in the 18th century, and by the mid-19th century all of Kazakhstan was part of the Russian Empire

Following the 1917 Russian Revolution, and subsequent civil war, the territory of Kazakhstan was reorganized several times before becoming the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic in 1936, an integral part of the Soviet Union.

Kazakhstan was the last of the Soviet republics to declare independence following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991; the current President, Nursultan Nazarbayev, has been leader of the country since then

Kokand Khanate used weakness of Kazakh jÃ¼zs after Dzungar and Kalmyk raids and conquered present Southeastern Kazakhstan including Almaty, formal capital at first quarter of 19th century

From the 1890s onwards, ever-larger numbers of settlers from the Russian Empire began colonizing the territory of present-day Kazakhstan, in particular the province of Semirechye

During the 19th century about 400,000 Russians immigrated to Kazakhstan, and about one million Slavs, Germans, Jews, and others immigrated to the region during the first third of the 20th century

In 1920, the area of present-day Kazakhstan became an autonomous republic within the Soviet Union.

In 1936 Kazakhstan became a Soviet republic

Kazakhstan experienced population inflows of millions exiled from other parts of the Soviet Union during the 1930s and 1940s; many of the deportation victims were deported to Siberia or Kazakhstan merely due to their ethnic heritage or beliefs

For example, after the German invasion in June 1941, approximately 400,000 Volga Germans were transported from Western Russia to Kazakhstan.

In 1953, Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev initiated the ambitious "Virgin Lands" program to turn the traditional pasture lands of Kazakhstan into a major grain-producing region for the Soviet Union

 On 16 December 1991, Kazakhstan became the last Soviet republic to declare independence

Caught up in the groundswell of Soviet republics seeking greater autonomy, Kazakhstan declared its sovereignty as a republic within the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in October 1990

Following the August 1991 aborted coup attempt in Moscow and the subsequent dissolution of the Soviet Union, Kazakhstan declared independence on 16 December 1991.

The capital was moved in 1998 from Almaty, Kazakhstan's largest city, to Astana.

When the Soviet Union collapsed in December 1991, Kazakhstan inherited 1,410 nuclear warheads and the Semipalatinsk nuclear-weapon test site

By April 1995, Kazakhstan had returned the warheads to Russia and, by July 2000, had destroyed the nuclear testing infrastructure at Semipalatinsk.

On 2 December 2009, UN Secretary GeneralBan Ki-moon and the Republic of Kazakhstan designated 29 August as International Day against Nuclear Tests, the same day the Semipalatinsk test site closed in 1991.

Since independence in 1991, Kazakhstan has pursued what is known as the "multivector foreign policy" , seeking equally good relations with its two large neighbors, Russia and China as well as with the United States and the rest of the Western world.

Kazakhstan sent 49 military engineers to Iraq to assist the US post-invasion mission in Iraq

Kazakhstan's National Security Committee  was established on 13 June 1992

Kazakhstan's government transferred its capital from Almaty to Astana on 10 December 1997.

Gas production in Kazakhstan in 2003 amounted to 13.9 billion cubic meters , up 22.7% compared to 2002, including natural gas production of 7.3 billion cubic meters 

Kazakhstan instituted an ambitious pension reform program in 1998

Development of petroleum, natural gas, and mineral extractions, such as potassium, has attracted most of the over $40 billion in foreign investment in Kazakhstan since 1993 and accounts for some 57% of the nation's industrial output 

Energy Information Administration Kazakhstan was producing approximately 1,540,000 barrels  of oil per day in 2009.

One of the largest known being the Karatau basin with 650 million tonnes of P2O5 and Chilisai deposit of Aktyubinsk/Aqtobe phosphorite basin located in north western Kazakhstan, with a resource of 500â800 million tonnes of 9% ore.

As of May 2014, Kazakhstan attracted $190 billion in gross foreign investments since its independence in 1991 and it leads the CIS countries in terms of FDI attracted per capita

Kazakhstan will be able to reach the UN standards by 2019 or 2020, if in the medium term the housing growth rate remains within 7 percent.

Some minorities such as Germans  , Ukrainians, Koreans, Chechens,Meskhetian Turks, and Russian political opponents of the regime had been deported to Kazakhstan in the 1930s and 1940s by Stalin; some of the bigger Soviet labour camps  existed in the country.

Before 1991 there were one million Germans in Kazakhstan; most of them emigrated to Germany following the breakup of the Soviet Union

On 29 December 1911 Mongolia declared independence from the Qing Dynasty and this National Liberation Revolution ended 220 years of Manchu rule .

Shortly thereafter, the country came under Soviet control, resulting in the proclamation of the Mongolian People's Republic as a Soviet satellite state in 1924

After the breakdown of communist regimes in Europe in late 1989, Mongolia saw its own peaceful democratic revolution in early 1990; it led to a multi-party system, a new constitution of 1992, and transition to a market economy.

At 1,564,116 square kilometres , Mongolia is the 19th largest and one of the most sparsely populated independent countries in the world, with a population of around 3 million people

Mongolia joined the World Trade Organization in 1997 and seeks to expand its participation in regional economic and trade regimes.

Until 1911, the Qing Dynasty maintained control of Mongolia with a series of alliances and intermarriages, as well as military and economic measures

By 1911 there were 700 large and small monasteries in Outer Mongolia and 115,000 monks who made up 21% of the population

Main articles: Mongolian Revolution of 1911, Mongolia , Mongolian Revolution of 1921, Mongolian People's Republic, 1990 Democratic Revolution in Mongolia and History of modern Mongolia

With the fall of the Manchu's Qing Dynasty, Mongolia under the Bogd Khaan declared independence in 1911

In 1919, after the October Revolution in Russia, Chinese troops led by Xu Shuzheng occupied Mongolia.

However, as a result of the Russian Civil War, the White Russian Lieutenant GeneralBaron Ungern led his troops into Mongolia in October 1920, defeating the Chinese forces in Niislel KhÃ¼ree  in early February 1921 with supports by Mongols

This Mongolian army took the Mongolian part of Kyakhta from Chinese forces on March 18, 1921, and on July 6 Russian and Mongolian troops arrived in KhÃ¼ree

Mongolia's independence was declared once again on July 11, 1921

In 1924, after the Bogd Khaan died of laryngeal cancer or, as some sources claim, at the hands of Russian spies, the country's political system was changed and a Mongolian People's Republic was established

Soviets recognized the Mongolian People's Party as "real" communists in the 1960s after the suspicious death of Pan-Mongolist leader Choibalsan.

In Mongolia during the 1920s, approximately one-third of the male population were monks

The Stalinist purges in Mongolia that began in 1937 affected the Republic by killing more than 30,000 people

Russia stopped Buryats migration to the Mongolian People's Republic in 1930 to prevent Mongolian reunification

During the Soviet-Japanese Border War of 1939, the Soviet Union successfully defended Mongolia against Japanese expansionism

Mongolia fought against Japan during the Battles of Khalkhin Gol in 1939 and during the SovietâJapanese War in August 1945 to liberate Southern Mongolia from Japan and China

At 1,564,116&#160;km2 , Mongolia is the world's 19th-largest country 

Since the end of socialism, Mongolia has experienced a decline of total fertility rate  that is steeper than in any other country in the world, according to recent UN estimations: in 1970â1975, fertility was estimated to be 7.33 children per woman, dropping to about 2.1 in 2000â2005

In the late 1930s, the regime, then led by Khorloogiin Choibalsan, closed almost all of Mongolia's over 700 Buddhist monasteries and killed at least 30,000 people, of whom 18,000 were lamas

The Mongolian Stock Exchange, established in 1991 in Ulaanbaatar, is among the world's smallest stock exchanges by market capitalisation

Among the first attempts to introduce modernism into the fine arts of Mongolia was the painting Ehiin setgel  created by Tsevegjav in the 1960s

The first rock band of Mongolia was Soyol Erdene, founded in the 1960s

In the early 1990s, group Har-Chono put the beginning for Mongolia's folk-rock, merging elements of the Mongolian traditional "long song" into the genre.

Mongolian press began in 1920 with close ties to the Soviet Union under the Mongolian Communist Party, with the establishment of the Unen  newspaper similar to the Soviet Pravda

Freestyle wrestling has been practised since 1958 in Mongolia

Amateur boxing has been practised in Mongolia since 1948

Mongolian olympic boxing national team was founded in 1960

Communist government of Mongolia banned boxing during the period 1964-1967 but the government ended ban on boxing soon

Professional boxing began in Mongolia in the 1990s.

The Mongolian national team began playing national games again during the 1990s; but has not yet qualified for a major international tournament

Location of &#160;Zimbabwe&#160;&#160;

The first recorded use of "Zimbabwe" as a term of national reference was in 1960, when it was coined by the black nationalist Michael Mawema, whose Zimbabwe National Party became the first to officially use the name in 1961

According to Mawema, black nationalists held a meeting in 1960 to choose an alternative name for the country, and the names Machobana and Monomotapa were proposed before his suggestion, Zimbabwe, prevailed

The most major of these were the Zimbabwe African National Union , and the Zimbabwe African People's Union, led by Joshua Nkomo from its founding in the early 1960s.

From about 1300 until 1600, Mapungubwe was eclipsed by the Kingdom of Zimbabwe

1450â1760, Zimbabwe gave way to the Kingdom of Mutapa

The Zimbabwe Conservation Task Force released a report in June 2007, estimating 60% of Zimbabwe's wildlife has died since 2000 due to poaching and deforestation

The highest peak in Zimbabwe, Mount Nyangani at 2,593&#160;m  is located here as well as the Bvumba Mountains and the Nyanga National Park

Zimbabwe's total population is 12.97&#160;million

In 2006, Zimbabwe had one of the lowest life expectancies according to UN figure &#160;â 44 for men and 43 for women, down from 60 in 1990, but this has since recovered to 53 and 54 respectively

Meanwhile, with the invasion of Tibet by China in the 1950s, India sought to counterbalance the perceived military threat from its northern neighbour by taking pre-emptive steps to assert more influence in Nepal

India sponsored both King Tribhuvan  as Nepal's new ruler in 1951 and a new government, mostly comprising the Nepali Congress Party, thus terminating Rana hegemony in the kingdom.

After years of power wrangling between the king and the government, King Mahendra  scrapped the democratic experiment in 1959, and a "partyless" Panchayat system was made to govern Nepal until 1989, when the "Jan Andolan"  forced King Birendra  to accept constitutional reforms and to establish a multiparty parliament that took seat in May 1991

Nepal established relations with the People's Republic of China on 1 August 1955, and relations since have been based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence

According to the 2011 census, Nepal's population grew from 9 million people in 1950 to 26.5 million
